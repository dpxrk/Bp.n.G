Welcome to KappaBnb, a booking reservation website designed for State Capitol Buildings!

KappaBnb is a clone of the popular site, AirBnb.

KappaBnb features user's profile that lists their previous bookings and upcoming bookings. On the profile page, for past reservations, the users are able to make a review for their stay! Other features include viewing other bookings that are labeled by markers used by Google Maps Api.

This application is built upon Flask-SQLAlchemy and Postgres on the backend, while being managed by React/Redux on the front end.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The project was a sprint with two days of planning and a week long of uninterrupted coding time. Moving forward, things that I want to be able to implement are functionality for users to be able to communicate with other users for messaging, and also being able to create modals throughout the project.
